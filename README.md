# Vegoons do Mull

Feeding 12 hungry vegoons on a remote island for a week.

Little note with all the food we have to source to eat like comrades for the week.

We'll need to bring a lot of stuff with us, other stuff we can in all probability get at the Tobermory Co-op.

We'd like to avoid spending obscene amounts of money so we will avoid too much fake meat and focus on stuff easy to do big cooks with.

Once this list is OK'd we will allocate folks (preferably those who have cars and haven't organised much already) to go shopping and source the goods.

# Meal ideas

Each of these ideas has a main and starter and is already GF, or can be made GF through a single easy substitution. 

## Dinners
- lentil dal with rice / green salad
- cheese and bacon pasta / roast veg
- garlic tofu scallops and chips / macho peas
- refried bean burritos / fresh salsa and tortilla chips
- split pea stew with rice and veg / patatas bravas
- tofu katsu curry / pak choi salad

## Lunches

This is a bit looser; we can make sandwiches, burritos etc.

Bangers and mash if we get GF sausages.

Can bake our own breads for the wheat-munchers.
