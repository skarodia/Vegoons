# Vegoons do Mull

Feeding 12 hungry vegoons on a remote island for a week.

Little note with all the food we have to source to eat like comrades for the week.

We'll need to bring a lot of stuff with us, other stuff we can in all probability get at the Tobermory Co-op.

We'd like to avoid spending obscene amounts of money so we will avoid too much fake meat and focus on stuff easy to do big cooks with.

Once this list is OK'd we will allocate folks (preferably those who have cars and haven't organised much already) to go shopping and source the goods.
